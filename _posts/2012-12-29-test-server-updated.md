The server test.barroncraft.com has been updated to Minecraft 1.4.6. Some complex plugins such as NoCheatPlus has been disabled and only the basic functionality has been tested. Please report any issues on the [Github bug tracker](https://github.com/barroncraft/minecraft-dota-config/issues/) or the [forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1161133-minecraft-dota/). Once things have stabilized, the main servers will be updated.

**Update:** Everything else appears to be working so NoCheatPlus has been enabled.
