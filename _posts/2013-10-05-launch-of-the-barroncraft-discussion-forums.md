If you haven't already notice due to the new link on the site, Barron Minecraft [now has forums](http://forums.barroncraft.com).  For now, they are intended for discussing projects and ideas related to the offical servers as well as providing an area for people to apply to join the staff.  More uses will probably be added in the future, feel free to [discuss what you think they should be used for](http://forums.barroncraft.com/t/what-sort-of-features-do-you-want-to-see-out-of-this-forum/4/2).
