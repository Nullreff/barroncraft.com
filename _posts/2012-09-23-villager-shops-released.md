The main server dota.barroncraft.com has been updated with villager shops. Quite a few bugs have also been fixed and a new anti-cheating system has been implemented. These changes will be made public soon along with the custom map that goes with them. If you can't wait, check out the [testing branch](https://github.com/Nullreff/minecraft-dota-config/tree/testing) on Github.
