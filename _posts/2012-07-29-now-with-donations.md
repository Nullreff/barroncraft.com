Currently Barron Minecraft is run entirely out of my own pocket as a fun hobby. A few people mentioned that they wanted to help offset hosting costs so I've added some links to the [contribute page](http://barroncraft.com/contribute). Don't feel like you have to, the servers will continue running now and in the future regardless. However, if you do enjoy playing on my servers or use [my configuration](http://wiki.barroncraft.com/wiki/Minecraft_Dota#How_to_run_your_own_server) for your own server, please consider contributing in some form.
