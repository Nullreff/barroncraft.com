Our awesome hosting provider [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=72e6c5ec43f1c29dc1ca61e4669d819f7d052a4f) just [doubled the amount of ram they offer on their servers](http://blog.linode.com/2013/04/09/linode-nextgen-ram-upgrade/).  I'm working to migrate over dota2 and dota3 so while they are offline, both will resolve to the main dota server.  Once the migration is done, they will come back online.
