Mojang has stated that Minecraft 1.7 will [probably be released this Friday](https://mojang.com/2013/10/minecraft-1-7-the-update-that-changed-the-world/).  We won't be immediately updating so you will need [continue using 1.6](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/134298) to connect.  I'll be posting here as soon as we have a test server available for people to play on.  Once things become stable, the main server will be updated.
