The server running Minecraft Dota will be down on Tuesday , 06 11 for maintenance. The DNS for dota.barroncraft.com has been set to redirect to our second server which will continue to host Minecraft Dota during the downtime. If you have trouble connecting, try using dota2.barroncraft.com. Maintenance will last a 1-3 hours and should not impact players at all.

**Update:** Maintenance has been completed
