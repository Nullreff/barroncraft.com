The main server dota.barroncraft.com has been updated to 1.3. There are still some bugs remaining, namely a few towers are impossible to destroy. I'm actively working on a fix for the and expect to have it within the next few days.

**Update1:** This appears to be a bug with Bukkit or Minecraft itself, fixing this might take a bit.

**Update2:** Towers have been fixed. It's a bit hackish but it works, you can see the code [on Github](http://github.com/Nullreff/SimpleClansExtensions).
