I'd like to welcome our two new moderators Bluefishnair and Pyrofiredelta.  They will be working to keep the servers fun to play on and free from cheaters.  If you're interested in becoming a staff member, check out [our applications page](http://wiki.barroncraft.com/wiki/Applications).  Remember that you can contact the moderators at [report@barroncraft.com](mailto:report@barroncraft.com).
