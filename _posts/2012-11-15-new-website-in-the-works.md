Currently working on re-doing the Barron Minecraft website in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). I'm also building a live stats tracking site using [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/). As always, the code is open source and can be found on my [Github page](https://github.com/barroncraft).
