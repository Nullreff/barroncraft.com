As of today, I've been on hiatus from Barroncraft for 3 months.  Unfortunately, building Minecraft mini games no longer interests me and it's time to move on.  After talking with some staff, they are interested in continuing work.  Therefore, I'm putting out a notice to anyone with the skills and funds to keep this project going.  If you're interested, send an email to contact@barroncraft.com and we can work out the details.  If no one is interested, I'll be shutting down the servers on the 15th.

Thanks for the great games and fun times everyone, I wish you all the best :)
