We recently had an series of incidents involving the impersonation of various moderator accounts.  This was due to an [exploit in the server version](https://github.com/SpigotMC/Spigot/commit/5c6d64a8b7ad3b7204eb58be4fe7d0ff174a7949) we were running.  The server has been updated to the latest version and all bans from the last 48 hours have been rolled back.  We will be taking active measures to prevent this from happening again.  I'm sorry if you were the victim of any malicious activities while playing on the server.  Please send any questions or comments regarding this incident to [report@barroncraft.com](mailto:report@barroncraft.com).
