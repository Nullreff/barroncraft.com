The custom map running on the servers has been made public in the [Github repo](https://github.com/barroncraft/barron-minecraft-dota) for Minecraft Dota. A couple of minor changes such as ender chests and additional exchanges have been added as well. These changes will be released with Barron Minecraft Dota 4.1 some time in the next week. Until then, feel free to download and try them out. Just be sure to report any bugs you find.
