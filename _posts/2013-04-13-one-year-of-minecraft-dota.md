Exactly one year ago today, [Hypixel](http://hypixel.net/) (or Theory Movies as he was know as back then) [released the map](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY5XpjmpR78) that we all know and love, Minecraft Dota.  I initially [posted a server on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/s8cr0/minecraft_dota_released/c4bz6ec) and within minutes it was full.  The system back then [was rather crude](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1161133-minecraft-dota/page__st__120#entry14325399), but over time it's been improved and has now reached the point where I think it's a reasonably well balanced and fun to play game.  In celebration, I'd like to share some statistics from the past year of Minecraft Dota:

**Common Chat Words:**

* 275,873 from other players.
* 31,965 from mobs.

* 198 from suffocation.
* 150 by pet wolves.
* 63 from explosions.

**Top Players:**

* A list of the [top 100 players by kills](/files/2012-2013_player_kills.txt).
* A list of the [top 100 players by deaths](/files/2012-2013_player_deaths.txt).

Some stats are approximations due to some early logs being in the wrong format.  If you have a stat not listed here that you want to see, [contact](mailto:contact@barroncraft.com) me to have it added.  Stats were compiled using `grep`, `sed`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc` and `vim`.  The big cloud of chat words was created using [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/).  I had a lot of fun putting all this together and look forward to another great year for Barron Minecraft.  Have fun playing :D
