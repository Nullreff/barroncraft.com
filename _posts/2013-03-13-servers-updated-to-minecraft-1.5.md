After a rather annoying [issue](https://github.com/barroncraft/minecraft-dota-config/issues/53) with Shopkeepers, Minecraft Dota is back up and running on 1.5.  This is done using the [snapshot-protocol option](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/802/) of [Spigot](http://www.spigotmc.org/).  If any more issue come up, please report them on the [bug tracker](https://github.com/barroncraft/minecraft-dota-config/issues?state=open).
