We've had a few minor updates since last time including:

* Banvote and LoginSecurity plugins added
* Minecraft scoreboard for kills
* Health displayed below player names
* Extra anvils in the special weapons shop
* Open fronted shops (no more dropping items behind the counter)

For a full list, check out the [commit list](https://github.com/barroncraft/minecraft-dota-config/compare/v4.3.0...v4.4.0). The [readme](https://github.com/barroncraft/minecraft-dota-config/blob/v4.4.0/README.md) file contains a good explanation on how to set it up. If you have any feedback or need help upgrading, send an email to [contact@barroncraft.com](mailto:contact@barroncraft.com).
