Minecraft Dota has been updated so it will automatically reset the map once the game is over. This means no more getting cut off in the middle of a long game or having to wait for a reset at the end of a short one. I'll be creating a writeup/tutorial on how this is done. In the meantime, you can check out the changes made to [the plugin](https://github.com/barroncraft/SimpleClansExtensions) that allows this to happen.
