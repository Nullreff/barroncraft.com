The two hard drives for my development server arrived and have been installed. Development should resume shortly. First change will be the adding of hats to the game (because everyone loves TF2). Also, the servers have been upgraded from 16 slots to 20 slots. Unless issues come up, they will stay this way. I may even look into making them larger in the future.
