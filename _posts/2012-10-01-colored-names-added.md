Colored nameplates have been added to the game. You will no longer have to guess if you should greet someone or attempt to kill them. Teammates show up as green and enemies show up as red. Please report any issues with this feature on the [SimpleClansExtension bug tracker](https://github.com/Nullreff/SimpleClansExtensions/issues).
