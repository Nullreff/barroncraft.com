More updates have been made to the Minecraft Dota server:

* Nexus upgrades now use hoppers so you can throw stacks of items in rather than one at a time.
* The Flame Sword and Aqua Helmet now have actual names!  Also the Flame Sword has been nerfed to only have Fire Aspect II.
* There are now fences in front of the shops to prevent you from dropping items over.
* Command blocks now announce when each team is ready.
* An exploit involving early access to the Flame Sword has been fixed.
