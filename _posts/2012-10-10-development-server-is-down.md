I have a bit of bad news to report. This weekend the primary hard drive on my home server died. While all the data on it was backed up, I no longer have a local server to use for development and testing. Until I get a new hard drive for it, you won't be seeing many updates to the game.

In happier news, I've begun putting together recruitment for server staff. More on this will be posted later.
