Great news everyone!  I just finished migrating two of our servers to [Newark, New Jersey](https://maps.google.com/?q=Newark,+New+Jersey) and [London, England](https://maps.google.com/?q=London,+England).  This means that US East and EU players will have nearby servers with minimal latency.  You can see the updates on the [servers](http://barroncraft.com/servers) page.
