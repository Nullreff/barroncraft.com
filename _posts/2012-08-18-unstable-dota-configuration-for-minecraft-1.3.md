As many of you probably noticed, my currently published configuration does not work well with Minecraft 1.3. I'm working on fixing all the bugs and issues that came from Minecraft updating and once I'm sure its stable I'll publish it. If you want to try the new configuration out a little early, all the files are available from the [testing branch](https://github.com/Nullreff/barron-minecraft-dota/tree/testing) on Github. This is extremely close to whats currently running live on the the servers and as far as I know, works properly.
