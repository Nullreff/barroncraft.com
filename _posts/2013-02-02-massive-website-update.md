The whole website has been rebuilt from the ground up using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).  This project has been in the works for a long time and I'm glad to finally be able to release it.  You should definitely check out the new [contribute page](/contribute/) for ways to get involved.  As always, the [source is available](https://github.com/barroncraft/barroncraft.com/) for anyone interested.
